description: 'For my second Flatiron School project, I modeled house prices in King County, Washington against a number of predictors––square footage, number of bathrooms, year built, etc.––using multiple linear regression. The model was built for the purpose of inference moreso than prediction. Find the full project on <a href="https://github.com/stlanier/Flatiron-School-Module-2-Project">GitHub</a>.'
