description: 'I tried out a bunch of different binary classifier to predict heart disease. I focused on exploring a variety of relatively simple classifiers (read: no neural networks)––Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Random Forests, AdaBoost and XGBoost, KNN––and fine tuning each to upwards of 85% accuracy on test data. My final model, an ensemble Voting Classifier, combines some of the best models to achieve 89% accuracy on test data.
