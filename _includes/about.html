                      I live in Seattle where I'm currently enrolled in Flatiron School's Data Science Program.
                      Previously, I lived in Tokyo and worked as a translator from Japanese to English, and before that
                      I had a 20 year stint in the Bible Belt.
                      The two loves of my life are books and plastic forks (featured at left, I-Spy edition).
                      Three quotes to live by:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      石の上にも三年。'Even sitting on a rock, wait three years.' <br>
                      – a Japanese proverb
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Your target audience is your younger self. <br>
